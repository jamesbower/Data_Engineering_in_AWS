## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An AWS Account
- Familiarity with AWS SQS
- Basic understanding of Data Engineering concepts

## Use Cases

- **Message Buffering**: Using SQS as a buffer between data producers and consumers.
- **Task Queues**: Implementing SQS for task queue purposes in ETL workflows.
- **Decoupling**: Decoupling different components of a data engineering pipeline.

## Configuration

Here you'll find various configuration templates for setting up SQS queues, including standard queues, FIFO queues, and more.

## Examples

In this section, you'll find code examples that demonstrate how to integrate SQS into your data engineering workflows. These examples include creating queues, sending messages, and consuming messages.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `Examples` folder for code snippets.
2. Check out the `Configuration` folder for setup templates.
3. Refer to the use-case specific READMEs for more detailed implementations.
